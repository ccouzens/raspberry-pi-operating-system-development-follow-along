Raspberry Pi Operating System Development Follow Along
======================================================

This code is from the [Cambridge Raspberry Pi operating system tutorial] (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/freshers/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/)

I aim to follow along with this git repository.

I am using Ubuntu.
I am not using the suggested toolchain (or maybe I am, but I installed it differently).
Instead, I have installed [arm-linux-gnueabi](apt://arm-linux-gnueabi)
